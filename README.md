# ElfParser
Parse DWARF2 data from ELF files and print global variables (incl. structs). Built solely for my own intent as I couldn't find anything to extract structs from my ELF files. Feel free to file issues and submit PRs if you have suggestions for improvement.

## Build environment
Built using Visual Studio Express 2015 with the excellent NuGet package [ELFSharp](https://github.com/konrad-kruczynski/elfsharp) by [Konrad Kruczy≈Ñski](https://github.com/konrad-kruczynski).
